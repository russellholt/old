# xmx

this is a simple fractal drawing app for the X Window System, written sometime around 1993.  iirc,
it was originally developed and ran on [one of these](http://obsolyte.com/sun_ipx/). It probably
won't compile or run on modern Unix systems.

it uses a tiny custom widget set written on top of xt, just for fun.
